************ Family Accounting Tool ******************
******************************************************


The Familiy Accounting Tool keeps track of every transaction your family makes. Its goal is to:
    - Extract usefull statistics from the data (e.g. how much do you spend on food per month?)
    - Calculate internal debt. For example: Alice buys toilet paper for the whole family with
      her own money. This tool then registers that the family ows Alice the cost of the toilet
      paper.
    - Provide a way to check if no money is disappearing in unexpected expenses (like banking
      costs or lost cash)


================ Requirements ================
Webserver (local or on the internet) with:
    - php 5
    - MySQL
    - Apache
installed.


================ Installation ================
- enable mod_rewrite in Apache
- load structure.sql into a database table


================ Configuration ================
=== Configuration files ===
Please modify the files:
    - settings.php
    - settings_accounting.php
    - settings_local.php
as many default settings are dummy settings.

=== Creating user accounts ===
An admin account is created by default with login:
    - login name: admin
    - password:   admin
make sure to change this password.

Now you can create an account for each participating family member, using the 'add user'-tool
in the Admin tab. Please make sure that the name corresponds with the account name you chose
in settings_accounting.php.


================ Usage ================
The hardest part of using this tool is to correctly input the transactions. Therefore, it's
important to understand the meaning of the categories and accounts.

=== Categories ===
These are used to split up your expenses into categories. Every account has some special
categories:
    - accounting category: used for non-real income/expenses. This category will be ignored
      when analysing your montly surplus/deficit in terms of expenses. Use this category e.g.
      when your expense will be payed back by your employer
    - endowment category: used for money transfer to the common account (see example in the
      next section)

=== Accounts ===
An account can refer to a regular person or the common account.

For example: a family has two members: Alice and Bob.
There will be three accounts: Alice, Bob and the common account. Alice and Bob will regularly
transfer money to the common account which can be used to make common expenses. This transfer
to the common account is called an 'endowment'.

=== Inputting transactions ===
** Regular entry **
Use this for everything that is not covered in the other special entries. 
Special fields:
    - beneficiary:
      in case of an expense: the one that will benefit from the expense
      in case of an income: the one that was paid
    - payed with/to:
      in case of an expense: payed with
      in case of an income: payed to
    - Flow:
      in case of an expense: negative number representing the price
      in case of an income: positive number

** Withdrawal **
Use this when you withdrew money from your bank account.

** Endowment **
Use this when you transfer money from your account to the common account.

=== Using the Cash Flow overview ===
The cash flow overview is a very powerfull tool to check for unaccounted expenses.

Firstly, you should set the current amount of money you have for every payment method (cash,
card, ...). You can do this by using the "set balance" link. Thereafter, whenever you perform
a transaction, the balance will be updated. Later, you can re-count your cash and see if it
matches the calculated value. If it does, you can use the "set balance" link and press "Ok"
right away. It will annote the balance as verified. If the money you counted does not match
the calculated value, you have made an error or lost money.
